# Stock-Notifier

A script that helps get high-in-demand products in the hands of consumers by immediately notifying you via email when an item on Best Buy's site is in stock. Helps save you the time and stress of worrying when a product will be in stock for you to purchase it. Made with Python 3.9.6
